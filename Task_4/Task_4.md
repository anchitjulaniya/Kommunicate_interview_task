4. Description of the Best Project(backend)
One of the best projects I've worked on is a real-time bidding engine. This project was a part of a larger system designed to allow users to place bids on various items in real time. The system needed to handle multiple users bidding simultaneously, update the bid status live, and manage all the auction-related activities.

Key Features:
Real-Time Updates: Using WebSockets, the system provided real-time updates to all participants in an auction.
Bid Management: Users could place, update, or withdraw bids. The highest bid was automatically updated and displayed to all participants.
Countdown Timer: Each auction had a countdown timer, which was displayed on the dashboard and updated in real time. This required careful synchronization between the server and the client.
Responsive UI: The frontend was built using React.js and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience across devices.
Backend: The backend was built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, handling bid placement, user authentication, and data storage.
Technologies Used:
Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
Real-Time Communication: WebSockets
Authentication: JWT
Unfortunately, this was an internal project and is not publicly accessible. However, it was a great learning experience in working with real-time data and building a robust full-stack application.
